# World_Weather_Analysis

This challenge was designed to put the work that we had learned throughout the API module into practce. We were tasked with reading from various APIs to get information on the weather for various cities across the world. We also leveraged Google Maps API to generate visualizations for application users.

The output of the challenge work can be found in the Challenge directory. I have put the work from the module in the appropriate folder also.
